          <h2>Welcome to the Middle of the World <span>  QUITO  </span></h2>
          <p> We’re going to learn about volcanoes, location, sister cities, airport, seasons, altitude sickness, and a lot more!</p>

        <div class="columns" style="background-color:#28587b;">Facts </div>
        <p> Nicknamed “Light of America”, Quito is the capital city for the Republic of Ecuador. Elevated 9,350 feet (2,850 meters) above sea level, Quito is both the world’s highest national capital and the country capital closest to the equator.In 2008, the city was designated as the headquarters of the Union of South American Nations.
           Because of its elevation, Quito receives some of the greatest solar radiation in the world, sometimes reaching a UV Index of 24 by solar noon.</p>
        <div class="columns" style="background-color:gray;">Accesibility</div>
        <p> Direct flights to Ecuador’s international airports in Quito and Guayaquil depart from a relatively small number of places outside of Latin America. In the United States, regular services leave from Miami, Houston and Atlanta; in Europe, they go from Madrid and Amsterdam. Higher prices are likely in the July to September high season and during December.
          While there are few direct routes to Ecuador, it’s easy to pick up connecting flights to the main hubs. From the US, direct routes to Quito and Guayaquil are operated by American Airlines, Delta, LATAM and United from Atlanta, Houston and Miami. JetBlue and Spirit fly from Ft Lauderdale. Avianca and Copa Airlines have indirect flights via cities such as Bogotá, Panama City and San Salvador (El Salvador). There are no direct flights from Canada to Ecuador; Canadian travellers generally have to travel via the US or Mexico, with Aeroméxico.
          Approximate flying times from the US to Quito without stops are around four hours from Miami, and around five hours from Houston and Atlanta. Prices are roughly $500–700 return from Miami, $600–800 from Houston and Atlanta, and CAN$700–900 from Toronto, but shop around, as prices can vary greatly.
         </p>
         <div class="columns" style="background-color:#28587b;">Things to do</div>

         <p>There are plenty of things to do in Quito itself to fill several days of a packed itinerary. Quito contains:
            dozens of historic buildings to discover in Old Town,
            more than fifty museums to tour,
            great city parks to stroll,
            the unique opportunity of visiting the equator line,
            hundreds of ornate churches to admire,
            hiking trails to trek from right within the city, and
            a ride from the city into the Andes one of the highest cable cars in the world.
          </p>
         <div class="columns" style="background-color:gray;">Weather</div>
         <p> In Quito, the wet season is cool and overcast and the dry season is comfortable and partly cloudy. Over the course of the year, the temperature typically varies from 48°F to 66°F and is rarely below 44°F or above 70°F.
      Based on the tourism score, the best time of year to visit Quito for warm-weather activities is from mid June to mid September </p>
